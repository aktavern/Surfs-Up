# Surfs-Up
This repo contains a jupyter notebook which uses SQLAlchemy to connect to a sqlite database to query data and subsequently plot that data. 

It also contains a Flask app which uses SQLAlchemy to connect to a sqlite database to provide responses to queries. Note that while debug is off, the JSON responses appear a little off. 

Concepts included:
* python
* SQL
* APIs
